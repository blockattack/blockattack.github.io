        <title>Preview of 2.0.0 as of 2016-03-20</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TLDR: There is a preview version that are likely better for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first version of Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks was released back in 2005.
This is now more than 10 years ago. Back then I did not have the knowledge and experience that I have today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many other programmers have thought: “This is too hard to maintain. I’ll just scratch it and start over”. &lt;br /&gt;
However that is not so simple. As Joel Spolsky writes in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html&quot;&gt;“Things You Should Never Do, Part I”&lt;/a&gt;: That the single biggest mistake you can do is to rewrite code from scratch.
Rewriting from scratch may give you better code but you are also throwing out a working system and all the lessens learned from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead I have been attacking and refactoring the bad parts of the game.&lt;br /&gt;
The code have been split into smaller pieces or packed behind an interface layer that I can manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some things that I had to cut out for the time being.&lt;br /&gt;
Both the old net code and the replay functionality was “hacked” into the game. They had to go.&lt;br /&gt;
The old mouse play function was not done with touch in mind. It had to go too.&lt;br /&gt;
Game controllers must now be supported by SDL2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDL library have been updated from SDL1.2 to SDL2. I must admit that I was about giving up several times while rewriting that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to reintroduce those things gain but I’ll rather release often once I have something that most people will consider better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the 2.0.0 version is already better in many ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It has a keyboard and game controller friendly menu system.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It runs significantly faster on most systems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It supports international characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screen shot of the new keyboard and game controller friendly menu:&lt;br /&gt;

        <title>Version 1.4.2 is out!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A miner upgrade to version 1.4.2 has just been uploaded. Less than 5 years after 1.4.1 the new and improved version is already available. The Windows uninstaller now works on Vista/7/8. But that is also about that is changed. I have been working on a 1.5.0 version that has a much more keyboard friendly menu and True Type fonts but it has lacked the final polish and has done so for quite a long time. I have also looked into a BlockAttack 2 that fixes some of the original design flaws (the fixed windows size, network model etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>RotBCustPuzzles by nin10doadict</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a long time since the last update. However I received an e-mail from nin10doadict about a week ago and it included some custom puzzles. They are very hard but if you like you can grab them here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blockattack.net/attachments/RotBCustPuzzles&quot;&gt;RotBCustPuzzles&lt;/a&gt;. The file must be placed in the puzzles directory. Linux uses may also place the file in ~/.gamesaves/blockattack/puzzles/. To get an idea of the difficulty of the puzzles you might want to view his YouTube video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PwkA_EQatM&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Key mapping and a video</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have uploaded a new video that shows all gametypes and also shows how to change key mapping. Apparently the key mapping is one of the major problems in the game. The default key setting: &lt;strong&gt;Left, Right, Up, Down, RShift and RCtrl&lt;/strong&gt; is not logical. Perhaps Left shift and ctrl would be better. In my last update I wrote about my plans for future versions. The current SVN version does have some of those features: Like a menu system that can be navigated without a mouse, must hard coded texts have also been replaced by translatable strings. One of the things that personally annoys me the most is that I must move my hands from the keyboard/game pad to the mouse to start a new game. This will go hopefully go away. For now here is the video.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Version 1.4.1 is out</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Version 1.4.1 was uploaded to SourceForge a few days ago. There is not much new in this release, mostly background stuff for the Linux version and I have not bothered creating a Windows version this time. The game not requires PhysFS - a file system abstraction layer. Theme support is also added and at some point I might upload a theme to show that it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things that I still have planned are: New menu system that can be navigated without mouse, lobby system for multiplayer, integrated puzzle level editor and upload of highscores and such. Don’t expect anything soon though, a yearly release is still the most likely scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A video showing VS mode</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I do not think this page shows what the game is about so I have created a video to show the VS mode and the AI in version 1.4.0:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Version 1.4.0 is out</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is here! Version 1.4.0. It does not feature all the functionality I had hoped for but it is till a major step up from 1.3.2. Qubodup’s graphics is the biggest news but there are more changes including more statistics to read.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New graphics by qubodup</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a while… I am working on the next version of Block Attack but it will not arrive until January or February. The next version will feature some new and greatly improved graphics by qubodup. There will be statistics so you can see how much you have accomplished so far. And not a little screenshot to show that things are happening.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Version 1.3.2 is out</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Version 1.3.2 has just been uploaded. It is mostly bug fixes. Enet, the networking library used, has been upgraded from version 1.0 to 1.1 so network support with 1.3.1 uses is not possible (except some Linux versions that already used 1.1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope the next release will be within a year.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A new version is comming...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on a new version that I hope to release in the beginning of January.
It will feature a new Replay format that will take up less space and allow games longer than 5 minutes to be recorded. I am going to move to enet 1.1 meaning that network backward compatibility will be broken. However currently bundled versions of Block Attack is already using the new version.&lt;/p&gt;
