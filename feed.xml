    <title>Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks</title>
    <description>Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks is a puzzle/blockfall game inspired by Tetris Attack (Panel de Pon in Japan) for the SNES.  The game is pretty action packed for a puzzle game :-)

        <title>Linux build added</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While I develop and run the game almost exclusively on Linux I have not provided a precompiled version so far. That has changed now. After having experimented with Docker and reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itch.io/docs/itch/integrating/platforms/linux.html&quot;&gt;itch.io package guide&lt;/a&gt;. I have now decided to try to provide a precompiled Linux version. I have tested it on old versions of Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora but not versions that have reached end-of-life. I have skipped out on CentOS. While the source is still the safest option this should give an easier alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Version 2.1.2 released</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Version 2.1.2 has been released.
This is just a small hotfix for the Windows version. The Windows version would fail to save correctly if “My Games” did not exist. Now it is created.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Version 2.1.1 released</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Version 2.1.1 has been released! Read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blockattack/blockattack-game/af19221e24dca72a4433bc075f47c785b858eb7a/ReleaseNotes-2.1.1.txt&quot;&gt;release note&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blockattack.net/download/&quot;&gt;download it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well there was a short lived 2.1.0 but mstraube found a blocking bug that I had to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has the first gameplay change in a long time. In the previous version the rise would stop
while clearing. It could stop for several seconds. This is no longer the case. The time is now
bound and will lower as the game progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One change may especially be of interest to a lot of people: The resolution can now be changed. It is a bit of a raw feature. The text is not easy to read etc. But for people that want to run in a window on a small screen it is now an option.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Version 2.0.1 is released. Read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blockattack/blockattack-game/v2.0.X/ReleaseNotes-2.0.1.txt&quot;&gt;Release Notes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blockattack.net/download/&quot;&gt;download it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very minor update. It only has two changes: The animation for “Get ready” and the manpage have been fixed.
There are other changes in the master branch on GitHub but they are not yet ready for release.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Now also without installer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The download section now contains a Windows version without an installer.
I always preferred that kind of installation myself but for some reason I have never provided one until now.
This makes it much easier to have multiple versions installed.
It was Gig that &lt;a href=&quot;http://openarena.ws/board/index.php?topic=5252.msg53795#msg53795&quot;&gt;mentioned it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blockattack.net/download/&quot;&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; or on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blockattack/blockattack-game/releases/tag/v2.0.0&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Version 2.0.0 released</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Version 2.0.0 is released. Read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blockattack/blockattack-game/v2.0.X/ReleaseNotes-2.0.0.txt&quot;&gt;Release Notes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blockattack.net/download/&quot;&gt;download it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to release software. Especially then you do not have a deadline.
Software is never ‘done’, it is just ‘release ready’.
But I am happy to release 2.0.0 today because it is better than 1.4.2 in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure it has lost a few features like Network play and saved replays. But they worked poorly anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However version 2.0.0 has better keyboard support, better gamepad support and better mouse support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It always annoyed me that while I could play with the keyboard, I still needed to use the mouse to control the menu.
Not a problem anymore. Now you can control the menu with only the keyboard, only the mouse or only a game controller or a mix of them if you want!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preview of 2.0.0 as of 2016-03-20</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TLDR: There is a preview version that are likely better for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first version of Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks was released back in 2005.
This is now more than 10 years ago. Back then I did not have the knowledge and experience that I have today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many other programmers have thought: “This is too hard to maintain. I’ll just scratch it and start over”. &lt;br /&gt;
However that is not so simple. As Joel Spolsky writes in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html&quot;&gt;“Things You Should Never Do, Part I”&lt;/a&gt;: That the single biggest mistake you can do is to rewrite code from scratch.
Rewriting from scratch may give you better code but you are also throwing out a working system and all the lessens learned from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead I have been attacking and refactoring the bad parts of the game.&lt;br /&gt;
The code have been split into smaller pieces or packed behind an interface layer that I can manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some things that I had to cut out for the time being.&lt;br /&gt;
Both the old net code and the replay functionality was “hacked” into the game. They had to go.&lt;br /&gt;
The old mouse play function was not done with touch in mind. It had to go too.&lt;br /&gt;
Game controllers must now be supported by SDL2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDL library have been updated from SDL1.2 to SDL2. I must admit that I was about giving up several times while rewriting that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to reintroduce those things gain but I’ll rather release often once I have something that most people will consider better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the 2.0.0 version is already better in many ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It has a keyboard and game controller friendly menu system.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It runs significantly faster on most systems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It supports international characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screen shot of the new keyboard and game controller friendly menu:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blockattack.net/images/blockattack2_menu_2016-03-20_14-30-11.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.blockattack.net/images/blockattack2_menu_2016-03-20_14-30-11_thump.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preview can be downloaded here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blockattack/blockattack-game/releases/tag/v.2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-2016-03-20&quot;&gt;Release page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Version 1.4.2 is out!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A miner upgrade to version 1.4.2 has just been uploaded. Less than 5 years after 1.4.1 the new and improved version is already available. The Windows uninstaller now works on Vista/7/8. But that is also about that is changed. I have been working on a 1.5.0 version that has a much more keyboard friendly menu and True Type fonts but it has lacked the final polish and has done so for quite a long time. I have also looked into a BlockAttack 2 that fixes some of the original design flaws (the fixed windows size, network model etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>RotBCustPuzzles by nin10doadict</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a long time since the last update. However I received an e-mail from nin10doadict about a week ago and it included some custom puzzles. They are very hard but if you like you can grab them here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blockattack.net/attachments/RotBCustPuzzles&quot;&gt;RotBCustPuzzles&lt;/a&gt;. The file must be placed in the puzzles directory. Linux uses may also place the file in ~/.gamesaves/blockattack/puzzles/. To get an idea of the difficulty of the puzzles you might want to view his YouTube video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PwkA_EQatM&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Key mapping and a video</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have uploaded a new video that shows all gametypes and also shows how to change key mapping. Apparently the key mapping is one of the major problems in the game. The default key setting: &lt;strong&gt;Left, Right, Up, Down, RShift and RCtrl&lt;/strong&gt; is not logical. Perhaps Left shift and ctrl would be better. In my last update I wrote about my plans for future versions. The current SVN version does have some of those features: Like a menu system that can be navigated without a mouse, must hard coded texts have also been replaced by translatable strings. One of the things that personally annoys me the most is that I must move my hands from the keyboard/game pad to the mouse to start a new game. This will go hopefully go away. For now here is the video.&lt;/p&gt;
