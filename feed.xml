    <description>Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks is a puzzle/blockfall game inspired by Tetris Attack for the SNES.  The game is pretty action packed for a puzzle game :-)

        <title>Version 1.4.2 is out!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A miner upgrade to version 1.4.2 has just been uploaded. Less than 5 years after 1.4.1 the new and improved version is already available. The Windows uninstaller now works on Vista/7/8. But that is also about that is changed. I have been working on a 1.5.0 version that has a much more keyboard friendly menu and True Type fonts but it has lacked the final polish and has done so for quite a long time. I have also looked into a BlockAttack 2 that fixes some of the original design flaws (the fixed windows size, network model etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Key mapping and a video</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have uploaded a new video that shows all gametypes and also shows how to change key mapping. Apparently the key mapping is one of the major problems in the game. The default key setting: &lt;strong&gt;Left, Right, Up, Down, RShift and RCtrl&lt;/strong&gt; is not logical. Perhaps Left shift and ctrl would be better. In my last update I wrote about my plans for future versions. The current SVN version does have some of those features: Like a menu system that can be navigated without a mouse, must hard coded texts have also been replaced by translatable strings. One of the things that personally annoys me the most is that I must move my hands from the keyboard/game pad to the mouse to start a new game. This will go hopefully go away. For now here is the video.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Version 1.4.1 is out</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Version 1.4.1 was uploaded to SourceForge a few days ago. There is not much new in this release, mostly background stuff for the Linux version and I have not bothered creating a Windows version this time. The game not requires PhysFS - a file system abstraction layer. Theme support is also added and at some point I might upload a theme to show that it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things that I still have planned are: New menu system that can be navigated without mouse, lobby system for multiplayer, integrated puzzle level editor and upload of highscores and such. Don’t expect anything soon though, a yearly release is still the most likely scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A video showing VS mode</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I do not think this page shows what the game is about so I have created a video to show the VS mode and the AI in version 1.4.0:&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is here! Version 1.4.0. It does not feature all the functionality I had hoped for but it is till a major step up from 1.3.2. Qubodup’s graphics is the biggest news but there are more changes including more statistics to read.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New graphics by qubodup</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a while… I am working on the next version of Block Attack but it will not arrive until January or February. The next version will feature some new and greatly improved graphics by qubodup. There will be statistics so you can see how much you have accomplished so far. And not a little screenshot to show that things are happening.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Version 1.3.2 is out</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Version 1.3.2 has just been uploaded. It is mostly bug fixes. Enet, the networking library used, has been upgraded from version 1.0 to 1.1 so network support with 1.3.1 uses is not possible (except some Linux versions that already used 1.1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope the next release will be within a year.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A new version is comming...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on a new version that I hope to release in the beginning of January.
It will feature a new Replay format that will take up less space and allow games longer than 5 minutes to be recorded. I am going to move to enet 1.1 meaning that network backward compatibility will be broken. However currently bundled versions of Block Attack is already using the new version.&lt;/p&gt;
