        </h2>
	<p>It is not that long ago that I updated the precompiled Linux build to be using SDL 2.0.6 instead of 2.0.5. Now I have another update. The compiled Linux build is now compiled on Ubuntu 12.04. This was a bit harder as Ubuntu 12.04 has reached end-of-life. However it was necessary as Ubuntu 14.04 is semi broken. At least the ubuntu:14.04 Docker image is broken. libsdl2-dev has been broken in 14.04 for months now. Even though I compiled my own version of SDL2 the build turned out to not work properly on other systems. Most notably the fullscreen support was broken. Well, that is now in the past.</p>

        </h2>
	<p>I have updated the standalone Lunux build to use SDL 2.0.6 instead of SDL 2.0.5. SDL 2.0.5 apparently has a problem with keyboard input that resulted in some keys being recorded double. This seems to only affect Ubuntu. I have updated the standalone package. While the new one has working keyboard support it appears that there still are some problem with the fullscreen support. It is weird as the version compiled against the distributions version of SDL2 works perfectly. I guess creating a standalone version is just problematic that way… still want to figure it out though.</p>

        </h2>
	<p>In the “old days” when you wanted to install a program then you downloaded it and installed it. Today that is not often the case. There are a large number of shops and download managers that takes care of most of the work. From a users point of view it is very convenient. So far I have not had Block Attack on any such platform. Most platforms are not geared towards independent developers or it was too cumbersome to setup. A couple of weeks ago I used the itch guide to create a standalone Linux version so the next step was logical: Add it to itch. I have now done so. I have tested it with the itch.io app and it works on both Linux and Windows. I’ll not stop distributing standalone copies but I believe you should have another option. Check it out <a href="https://sago008.itch.io/blockattack">here</a>.</p>

	<p>While I develop and run the game almost exclusively on Linux I have not provided a precompiled version so far. That has changed now. After having experimented with Docker and reading the <a href="https://itch.io/docs/itch/integrating/platforms/linux.html">itch.io package guide</a>. I have now decided to try to provide a precompiled Linux version. I have tested it on old versions of Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora but not versions that have reached end-of-life. I have skipped out on CentOS. While the source is still the safest option this should give an easier alternative.</p>

<p>Well there was a short lived 2.1.0 but mstraube found a blocking bug that I had to fix.</p>

<p>This has the first gameplay change in a long time. In the previous version the rise would stop
while clearing. It could stop for several seconds. This is no longer the case. The time is now
bound and will lower as the game progresses.</p>

<p>One change may especially be of interest to a lot of people: The resolution can now be changed. It is a bit of a raw feature. The text is not easy to read etc. But for people that want to run in a window on a small screen it is now an option.</p>

<p>It is difficult to release software. Especially then you do not have a deadline.
Software is never ‘done’, it is just ‘release ready’.
But I am happy to release 2.0.0 today because it is better than 1.4.2 in almost every way.</p>

<p>Sure it has lost a few features like Network play and saved replays. But they worked poorly anyway.</p>

<p>However version 2.0.0 has better keyboard support, better gamepad support and better mouse support.</p>

<p>It always annoyed me that while I could play with the keyboard, I still needed to use the mouse to control the menu.
Not a problem anymore. Now you can control the menu with only the keyboard, only the mouse or only a game controller or a mix of them if you want!</p>

        </h2>
	<p><em>TLDR: There is a preview version that are likely better for you.</em></p>

<p>The first version of Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks was released back in 2005.
This is now more than 10 years ago. Back then I did not have the knowledge and experience that I have today.</p>

<p>As many other programmers have thought: “This is too hard to maintain. I’ll just scratch it and start over”. <br />
However that is not so simple. As Joel Spolsky writes in his <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">“Things You Should Never Do, Part I”</a>: That the single biggest mistake you can do is to rewrite code from scratch.
Rewriting from scratch may give you better code but you are also throwing out a working system and all the lessens learned from it.</p>

<p>So instead I have been attacking and refactoring the bad parts of the game.<br />
The code have been split into smaller pieces or packed behind an interface layer that I can manage.</p>

<p>There were some things that I had to cut out for the time being.<br />
Both the old net code and the replay functionality was “hacked” into the game. They had to go.<br />
The old mouse play function was not done with touch in mind. It had to go too.<br />
Game controllers must now be supported by SDL2</p>

<p>The SDL library have been updated from SDL1.2 to SDL2. I must admit that I was about giving up several times while rewriting that.</p>

<p>I want to reintroduce those things gain but I’ll rather release often once I have something that most people will consider better.</p>

<p>Because the 2.0.0 version is already better in many ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It has a keyboard and game controller friendly menu system.</li>
  <li>It runs significantly faster on most systems.</li>
  <li>It supports international characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Screen shot of the new keyboard and game controller friendly menu:<br />

	<p>A miner upgrade to version 1.4.2 has just been uploaded. Less than 5 years after 1.4.1 the new and improved version is already available. The Windows uninstaller now works on Vista/7/8. But that is also about that is changed. I have been working on a 1.5.0 version that has a much more keyboard friendly menu and True Type fonts but it has lacked the final polish and has done so for quite a long time. I have also looked into a BlockAttack 2 that fixes some of the original design flaws (the fixed windows size, network model etc.).</p>

        </h2>
	<p>I have uploaded a new video that shows all gametypes and also shows how to change key mapping. Apparently the key mapping is one of the major problems in the game. The default key setting: <strong>Left, Right, Up, Down, RShift and RCtrl</strong> is not logical. Perhaps Left shift and ctrl would be better. In my last update I wrote about my plans for future versions. The current SVN version does have some of those features: Like a menu system that can be navigated without a mouse, must hard coded texts have also been replaced by translatable strings. One of the things that personally annoys me the most is that I must move my hands from the keyboard/game pad to the mouse to start a new game. This will go hopefully go away. For now here is the video.</p>

	<p>Version 1.4.1 was uploaded to SourceForge a few days ago. There is not much new in this release, mostly background stuff for the Linux version and I have not bothered creating a Windows version this time. The game not requires PhysFS - a file system abstraction layer. Theme support is also added and at some point I might upload a theme to show that it works.</p>

<p>The things that I still have planned are: New menu system that can be navigated without mouse, lobby system for multiplayer, integrated puzzle level editor and upload of highscores and such. Don’t expect anything soon though, a yearly release is still the most likely scenario.</p>

	<p>Version 1.3.2 has just been uploaded. It is mostly bug fixes. Enet, the networking library used, has been upgraded from version 1.0 to 1.1 so network support with 1.3.1 uses is not possible (except some Linux versions that already used 1.1).</p>

        </h2>
	<p>The GCJ java version of the “Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks - Puzzle Level Editor” has been released in version 4. It know supports “Test” so you can automatically launch blockattack with the level you are working on (blockattack must be version 1.3.0 or newer). From the next version of blockattack I expect to be able to include it with the windows version too.</p>

	<p>I have tried a little different design of the homepage, still nothing fancy and totally wrong usage of tables. Also a deb-package can now be found on the Download page.</p>

	<p>Version 1.3.0 has been released today! Most notably is that gray garbage blocks have been introduced. Also “.” can now by typed making it easier to type IP addresses. See changelog (dead link removed) for more details. I also received a Spanish translation yesterday, I believe it works with 1.2.0 and newer. It can also be found on the download page.</p>

        </h2>
	<p>Today I have uploaded version 1.2.2 for Linux/Unix. Also a new version of the Level Editor that now can be compiled with gcj (GNU Compiler for Java). I also tried compiling the game on a 64 bit system (Ubuntu Dapper AMD64) and I got a 20% increase in performance, somewhat more than expected, since the game does not have any 64 bit optimization at all (but SDL might have). The Windows version is still 1.2.0 none of the new things in 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 applies to Windows.</p>

	<p>Yesterday I uploaded version 1.2.0. The game now has network functionality and Replays up to 5 minutes can be saved. Nothing new in the single player part.</p>

	<p>Not much new. I have received a patch for version 1.1.2 from Gonéri Le Bouder. He is <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=368395">packaging Block Attack for Debian</a>. I have uploaded the patch plus the patched source code plus some additions to the Source Forge mirrors. The changes in the patch are related to the makefile and the directory there the data files are loaded from. I hope that the patched version will make it easier to make packages should anyone want to.
I have been working on a new version 1.1.3 witch includes a Replay function (done) and network play. The patch will be incorporated in the next version.</p>

	<p>Version 1.1.2 of “Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks” can now be downloaded. Most of the changes are small. The CPU is a little better. Vs. Mode in Single Player. Some new graphic. The most important news is that small numbers pop-up when chaining, this should make people more aware of chains</p>

Basic AI (very stupid and very fast). New make file for linux. A starter for linux (can be started by double clicking the starter binary). Does not work in Windows 9x anymore.</p>
