# Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks homepage

Note that this is split into two repositories:
 * https://github.com/blockattack/blockattack-www contains the source
 * https://github.com/blockattack/blockattack.github.io contains the result

 
The reason this is split is because we use custom jekyll plugins that GitHub does not allow. So we generate everything offline and upload it.

# Requirements
```
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev 
#Some more things to install...
sudo gem install jekyll jekyll-redirect-from jekyll-sitemap
```
